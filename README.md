# Coding Project:
> We want you to build a mini symptom checker. The goal is to figure out which rare conditions a user has, given the symptoms they input. Your task is as follows:

    1. Parse this XML file here (http://www.orphadata.org/data/xml/en_product4.xml) to find the relationship between diseases and symptoms.
    2. Write a function which accepts a list of symptoms (HPO IDs) as input and returns an ordered list of the most relevant rare conditions. The method by which relevant conditions are selected is up to your discretion.
    3. Set up a server using Python Django/FastAPI/Flask which can accept symptoms via a HTTP request and return relevant conditions.
    4. Python Django is preferred, but if you do not know Python or Django, you may use a language or framework of your choice.
    5. Set up a React frontend which allows users to input symptoms, hits your API, and displays the conditions returned from the Python server. I will leave it up to you to decide how you want to display symptoms.
    6. We know that youâ€™re not very familiar with functional React components and hooks, so we would like to see how quickly you can tackle these new concepts. Please use functional components and hooks rather than class-based components.
    7. Please upload all code to a GitHub repository with instructions on how it works and how to run it in the readme. Finally, please make a list of edge cases that you might check for and future directions you would take the project.

## Criteria

> Below are the things we will be looking for when evaluating your project. Do not worry about Bonus points unless you have extra time to work on them.

### What we are looking for:
* Creativity and organization
* Production-ready bug-free code:
* Please make sure you use known best practices to design and structure your code for the best readability, testability, and maintainability.
* A functional UX:
    * Ability to easily select symptoms
    * Ability to view an ordered list of relevant conditions given the input symptoms
* An algorithm which roughly selects and ranks appropriate conditions based on symptoms
* A thoughtful list of edge cases and future directions

Bonus points:
* Unit testing of backend functions
* Using database models to store/query symptoms and conditions
* Easy development setup using something like Docker Compose
* A beautifully designed UI
* A symptom search tool for selecting symptoms
* A UI with enriched info allowing users to learn more about the symptoms/conditions

Extra bonus points:
 * Unit testing of frontend functions
 * Deployment on simple cloud provider like Heroku
